## Speed Hotkeys

This simple mod adds hotkeys for changing game speed instantly.
By default the number keys `1` - `5` are assigned to the normals speeds, this can be changed in the settings

## Caution
This uses the same keys as actions for selected items, use CTRL or ALT prefixes to prevent that or remap to your favorite keys.

There is an experimental mode which may be game breaking so use at own discretion.
